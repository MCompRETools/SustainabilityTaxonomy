**Sustainability Category Correlations**- It provides the identified correlations (Positive and Negative) among different sustainability categories.

**Research papers surveyed for taxonomy document**- It lists out 105 papers used for building the taxonomy and answering the research questions-

****RQ-1 How are sustainability requirements defined and characterized across different domains (e.g., stand-alone software, cloud computing, smart systems, healthcare)?**

**RQ-2 What are the most frequently identified categories of sustainability requirements for different dimensions in the existing state of the art (e.g., inclusivity for social dimension, energy consumption for environmental dimension)?**
